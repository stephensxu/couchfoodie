** KNOWN BUGS
- Reservation needs to show whether a kitchen still exist
- Use two facebook app; one for dev one for production

- Photo delete data-confirm doesn't work, why?

- If user delete front-page-photo and there are still photos left for a particular kitchen, it will not re-assign front-page-photo.

To-do:

- Write tests!
- Add detailed README
- Provide instruction for other developer to test the code
- Change reservation status "Denied" to "Declined". "Denied" is a harsh word.

### Additional feature to consider:

- Add google map API to let user be able to click on address to find kitchen location on google map.
