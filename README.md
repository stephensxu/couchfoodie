You don't like cooking that much and got sick of most local resturants; yet you still need to eat everyday.

I love cooking, whether it's fancy dinner cuisine or just sunday afternoon desserts; and I'm open to the idea of inviting a guest to taste my cooking!

What if there is a community platform that gap the supply and demand of homemade cooking?

You get...home cooked meal and a new friend!

I get...someone who appreciate my cooking and a new friend!

This is the golden opportunity to cure starvation, longingness and socialize with your neighbors!
