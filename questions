1. Between user and kitchen, should I use one-to-one or one-to-many?
If I use one-to-one; how can I prevent the data from being destroyed when use has to create new kitchen? 

2. How can I do validation for address input?
Street, City, State, Zipcode etc.

3. How can I require validation to view any of my kitchen_reservations?
