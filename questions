1. Between user and kitchen, should I use one-to-one or one-to-many?
If I use one-to-one; how can I prevent the data from being destroyed when use has to create new kitchen? 

2. How can I do validation for address input?
Street, City, State, Zipcode etc.

4. Should I spend time building more feature or testing?
