1. Between user and kitchen, should I use one-to-one or one-to-many?
If I use one-to-one; how can I prevent the data from being destroyed when use has to create new kitchen? 

2. How can I do validation for address input?
Street, City, State, Zipcode etc.

4. Should I spend time building more feature or testing?

BUG FIND FROM JESSE(8/19):

- Front page has no introduction
- Log in page not looking good
- No margin from header
- Reservation date is too far in the future
- "Guest" is unclear what it means
- Notice is mostly out of the place
- Notice would be above the footer in some pages
- In My Kitchen page, footer is on the top
- People can still edit kitchen after deletion
- Change record_status cannot be in view code, has to be controller code
- Change datatype of kitchen.description to text
- Add dropdown to State
